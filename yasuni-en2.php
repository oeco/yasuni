    <p>Ecuador’s capital city, Quito, lies at 250 km from the region known as Yasuní, the name of one of the rivers that cross it. Located to the west of the Amazon basin, its proximity to the Andes mountain range results in a rangy topography of hillocks and gorges for its rainforests. These are crisscrossed by creeks and swamps that form a hydric network where tapirs, capybaras, jaguars and crocodiles roam. The tallest trees reach 45 meters into the sky and stand out from the rest of the forest’s canopy, a high up area where branches and leaves overlap to produce shade for swamps and a lush underbrush.</p>

    <p>Yasuní has one of the planet’s richest biodiversity, still far from being understood by scientists. It is the ancient land of groups of indigenous people, some of which have chosen to live in isolation. It is also home to a growing number of settlers that arrive from other parts of Ecuador. Moreover, it holds Ecuador’s most important oil reserves. The exploitation of this resource threatens the forest with the building of pipelines and roads. These, in turn, encourage the arrival of more migrants, increasing its population, while also leading to deforestation and the reduction of wildlife.</p>

    <p>The region of Yasuní was acknowledged by UNESCO’s <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/pt/brasilia/natural-sciences/environment/biodiversity/biodiversity/mab-programme-in-brazil/" target="_blank">Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB)</a> as a Biosphere Reserve, an <a href="http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&code=ECU+02" target="_blank">area that covers 1,682,000 hectares</a>, that includes the Indigenous Territory of the Waorani and the Yasuní National Park. Also, contained in National Park’s southern portion, lies the Intangible Zone of Tagaeri-Taromenane.</p>

    <p>Up to the 1960s Yasuní was inhabited only by indigenous peoples living in isolation. A keen interest in oil exploitation was what drew both the government of Ecuador and oil companies to approach these indigenous tribes. Subsequently, a large portion of these populations was evicted from their lands.</p>

    <p>By 1979, sensitized by the importance of Yasuní for environmental protection, the government created a national park that covered an area of 982,000 hectares of this region. In 1983, 66,500 hectares to the west of the park’s estate were legalized as indigenous lands belonging to the Waorani. In 1989, the region was awarded the status of Biosphere Reserve. In 1990, the Ecuadorian government decreed an increase of almost ten times the original area reserved for the Waorani, reaching 612,560 hectares. The condition imposed on this concession was that they were not to oppose themselves to the exploitation of oil and gas within this territory.</p>

    <p>In 1999, the national park’s southern portion was defined as an Intangible Zone in order to ensure the rights of the Tagaeri-Taromenane people that live there in voluntary isolation. In 2007, the Intangible Zone was marked off at 758,051 hectares and officially handed over to its indigenous inhabitants. Within its borders there is no oil exploitation for, by law, it is untouchable.</p>

    <p>The Yasuní National Park itself has a troubled history. Over 30 years, its borders have changed several times due to the needs of oil exploitation. Today, within its boundaries, oil blocks named 14, 15, 16 and 67 are active and operational.</p>

    <p>There are also two others, blocks 31 and 43 that are still undergoing infrastructure construction work for exploitation. Alone, they amass 895 million oil barrels that correspond to one-third of Ecuador’s known reserves. Block 43 contains the fields of Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini, better known for its initials, ITT. The proposal from the environmental movement to put a moratorium on oil exploitation in ITT fields gave birth to one of the world’s most original and bold conservation programs.</p>

    <h1>The Yasuní-ITT Initiative</h1>
    
    <p>In August 2010, at the beginning of Rafael Correa’s presidential term, the government launched a plan in which it committed itself to abstain from exploiting oil from the Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) oil fields, from plot 43, located within Yasuní National Park, as long as it were financially compensated by the international community. This plan became known as the Yasuní-ITT Initiative.</p>

    <p>The goal was to obtain 3.6 billion dollars, or half the appraised value of the ITT oil reserve fields. After the official launch, in order to collect the cash, a fund was devised and managed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The resources from this fund would be destined to finance projects in Ecuador to protect biodiversity, upkeep protected areas and restore degraded areas. It would also be used for social programs and for the development of renewable sources of energy.</p>

    <p>The Yasuní-ITT Initiative was born from environmentalist groups concerned with the growing pollution caused by oil extraction activities in the 90s and also to defend the rights of indigenous people. ITT fields are located in Ecuador’s easternmost region, on the border with Peru, and cover an area of 200 thousand hectares. They represent 20% of the total surface of Yasuní National Park.</p>

    <p>The ITT Initiative counted on the support of 15 countries, 20 international entities, 65 governments from provinces and municipalities in Ecuador, aside from 39 alliances with domestic and foreign business sectors. However, up to 2013, it only received promises of 376 million dollars, or 10% of the desired total.</p>

    </div>

    <p>After several deadline extensions in order to receive international funds, on October 15, 2013, President Rafael Correa declared the initiative closed.</p>

    <p>When he abandoned the Yasuní-ITT Initiative, President Rafael Correa stated that the world had failed on Ecuador. However, during the period in which the ITT Initiative was in full force, the government continued with installations and infrastructure construction works for the exploitation of oil within ITT fields, a fact that generated doubts amongst interested countries, such as Germany, whether Ecuador would fulfill its part of the agreement.</p>

    <p>After the plan’s demise, despite opposition from environmentalists, the government announced the beginning of exploitation in ITT fields with a new promise: only 0.1% of the national park would be affected by oil extraction.</p>

    <p>However, it is not possible to know whether the negative effects on the forest will be proportional to the area exploited. The creation of roads and cleared areas, however small they may be, carry an increase of human settlements, hunting and lumber extraction, including protected areas.</p>

    <p>The story of the IIT Initiative transformed Yasuní into an international symbol. But what should’ve been a new model for preservation, died out before the ink dried on the official documents, so to speak.</p>

    <p>The movement to protect Yasuní returned to the environmental groups that are now busy amassing signatures from civil society to promote a citizen consultation, in which inhabitants will decide on the preservation or exploitation of oil in ITT fields.</p>
