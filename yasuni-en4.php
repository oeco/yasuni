        <p>Ecological characteristics, a variety of habitats and geographic localization made Yasuní a cradle for the development of new species.</p>

        <p>In the words of Stella de la Torre, doctor of Zoology from the University of San Francisco de Quito, the region’s rivers frequently alter their course and form natural barriers that can separate entire populations of wildlife and plant life alike. Environments with subtle differences exert evolutionary pressures that produce these distinct species in areas that are quite close to each other.</p>

        </div>

        <p>This mosaic of habitats was formed by the range of altitudes within an equatorial region close to the Andes mountain range, a phenomenon which is not witnessed in other regions of the Amazon basin. Yasuní is also one of the Amazonian regions with the highest rate of rainfall.</p>

        <p>It is estimated that it contains more than 4 thousand species of vascular plants. Up to this moment, 138 species of vines have been described, as well as 313 epiphytes (plants such as bromeliads and lichens), 140 ferns and similar plants, aside from 2,113 species of trees and shrubs (1,813 of which have been identified and 300 yet to be identified). A study found in a single hectare in Yasuní 655 species of trees, a number similar to the one found in all forests of North America.</p>

        <blockquote>A <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0008767" target="_blank">study</a> found in a single hectare in Yasuní 655 species of trees, a number similar to the one found in all forests of North America.</blockquote>

        <p>One hundred and seventy six species of mammals are known, among which more than 80 are bats. The list of birds has already reached 596 species, 40% of the total found in the Amazon basin. Amphibians and reptiles form a community of the planet’s richest herpetofauna, with 271 species. Fluvial and lacustrine (laky) systems are home to 382 species of fish, a number that exceeds the total amount found in the basin of river Mississippi, one of the three largest basins in the world. The sheer richness of insects mesmerizes specialists, who have already estimated some 100 thousand species in a single hectare.</p>

        <h2>Jaguars (or Kengiwe)</h2>

        <p>The jaguar <i>(Panthera onca)</i> is known by the name of kengiwe in the wao terero language of the Waorani tribe. According to beliefs, the kengiwe is the reincarnation of a warrior from the tribe. After death, warriors would return to the forest exhibiting a golden color, a robust body, a large head and powerful jaws.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Despite its strength and size, jaguars instinctively remain shy of people. However, with photographic traps, scientists have already recorded the species 250 times in the last 8 years. With these images, today it is known that 21 jaguars exist in the neighborhood of the Tiputini Biodiversity Station, in the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Jaguars hunt and devour everything that moves in rivers or in woodlands. Fish, rodents and wild boars are part of a list of 80 species of animals on the diet of these felines. Their presence is a sure sign of a healthy forest, for the species requires an abundance of game to survive. Each individual needs an area close to 10,000 hectares (equivalent to 10 thousand soccer fields) to find its sustenance and conditions to reproduce.</p>

        <p>In over 8 years of research in Yasuní, Diego Mosquera, Kelly Swing, David Romo and other researchers from the University of San Francisco de Quito obtained almost 55 thousand photographs of 60 different species, among mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, although only 600 hectares had been studied and the ecologists had not yet finished processing all of the animal records collected.</p>

        <h1>Hunting</h1>

        <p>In the last 40 years, the vast territory between rivers Napo and Cururay has changed. Roads invaded the area and allowed access to previously remote areas. Through these, indigenous people from the Waorani tribe and the recently arrived Kichwas indigenous people (the first indigenous group in the Ecuadorian Amazon to be catechized) hunt in locations in the forest which were once inaccessible or outside their communities. Besides, subsistence hunting was transformed into a commercial activity, making it unsustainable.</p>

        <blockquote>The Amazonian Kichwas indigenous people are the largest group within Yasuní National Park’s zone of influence. Their population grew along Napo River, as from the second half of the 19th century, during the expansion of the rubber industry.</blockquote>

        <div class="bigimage"><img style="width:800px;" src="img/via_auca/02_via_auca_full.jpg" alt="Photo by Martin R. Bustamante / www.biographica.com.ec">
        <p class="legend"><i>Photo by Martin R. Bustamante / www.biographica.com.ec</i></p>
        </div>
 
        <p>The flesh of wildlife captured in Yasuní is commercialized in Pompeya, a small township on the banks of Napo River. In marketplaces open on Saturdays, one can find the meat of wild boars, deer, turtle eggs and a variety of fish such as arapaima, curimbatá and bodós, which are sold to the people who come to the cities of Puyo, Coca and Tena.</p>

        <p>Years ago, this commerce was more evident. Repression on the part of Ecuador’s Ministry of the Environment made this activity more discreet, but also produced other commercialization points such as Chiro Isla, on the park’s northern portion.</p>

        <p>Wildlife meat is coveted because it has a ritual value for the native population of the Amazon. For tourists, on the other hand, it is regarded as a delicacy and a folkloric experience.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="lead">It is thought that close to 10 tons of  meat are sold illegally each year, especially derived from average-sized mammals, aside from birds and fish</div>

        <p>Ecologist Esteban Suárez, in partnership with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the University of San Francisco de Quito, researched the market at Pompeya and managed to put the magnitude of wildlife meat commerce into numbers. It is thought that close to 10 tons are sold illegally each year, especially derived from average-sized mammals, aside from birds and fish. “The scenario is discouraging, for this meat comes especially from mammals that already have a low population density, where the impact of hunting is stronger. We are seeing capture levels that will make the population of these animals collapse in the near future”, says Suárez.</p>

        <p>The benefits remain in the city, because go-betweens and restaurants sell this meat for five times the price paid to hunters. Meanwhile, animals are vanishing in the forest.</p>
