        <h1>The Tagaeris and the Taromenanes</h1>

        <p>Within Yasuní, in the ancient territory of the Waorani, there are clans that have chosen to live in isolation. They do not desire contact with anyone else, even with other indigenous tribes. These are the Tagaeri, a group derived from the same ancestral tree as the Waorani with whom they share their language, but without any kinship bond.</p>

        <p>Tagaeri is a descriptive name the Waorani use to designate those they do not know and generally means “those who wander” or “people of the path”. These are the people the Waorani glimpsed during their own hunting incursions.</p> 

        <p>The Tagaeri and the Taromenane are semi-nomadic people with an economy based on gathering, hunting and on itinerant horticulture. They are among the last people on Earth to have a culture and survival dependent on a tropical forest.</p>

        <p>Clashes between the Waorani and the Tagaeri-Taromenane cause deaths and are a danger for the survival of isolated groups. Such conflicts are traditional since these isolated groups used to fight among themselves over territorial control. The death of clan members would then be avenged, generating renewed conflict. Today, numbered among the victims of such skirmishes are settlers and illegal wood mongers that invade the territories of indigenous people.</p>
        
        <p>Isolated groups also live threatened by pressures from the extractivist industry in Yasuní. The radical reduction of their territory due to intense extractivist activities can mean the extinction of isolated tribes. They are getting closer and closer to Waorani and settler communities, their roaming space and resources are dwindling, while the availability of game is increasingly scarce and rivers are polluted.</p>

        <p>“In the last sightings report, there’s word of Taromenane people making contact with the Waorani to ask for food, in other words, they are suffering from the shortage of basic resources”, says Milagros Aguirre, director of the Alejandro Labaka Foundation.</p>

        <p>Created in 1999 and marked off in 2007 within the national park, the intangible zone of 758,051 hectares avoided the expansion of the oil industry into the park’s southern portion. However, such an area can be too small to preserve those isolated tribes since the roaming patterns and territorial boundaries of the Tagaeri-Taromenane people within the forest are unknown.</p>

        <p>Groups that defend human and environmental rights requested from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) that they promote protective actions in favor of the lives and cultures of the people who are living under risk. IACHR recommendations were made and accepted by the Ecuadorian government that, in 2008, devised the Cautionary Measures Plan to eliminate illegal activities inside the intangible zone. However, it has not yet achieved this goal.</p>

        <h1>The Settlers</h1>

        <p>The 70s in Ecuador were decisive for the protected areas in the country; several were created, the largest and most representative of vulnerable ecosystems. Meanwhile, oil exploitation was consolidated in the most important areas of the Ecuadorian Amazon: Cuyabeno and Yasuní.</p>

        <p>The displacement of the Waorani into the protectorate created by the ILV helped Texaco begin the construction work for the Auca road, the region’s main highway. Parallel to this, settlers both from the sierras and sea coast demanded new land for cultivation. This pressure drove colonization programs, especially in the Amazon portion. Soon migration of peasants began towards the so-called “no-man’s land”, where they received land but on condition that the forest had to be felled and replaced by plantations.</p>

        <p>Peasants arrived believing in the promises of available fertile land, but instead found only dense tropical forests and poor soil, inhabited by warring indigenous peoples and threatened by oil pollution. Today the population of settlers is already greater than that of indigenous people and the one who suffers the most from the frequent oil leaks. Settlers exhibit high levels of alcoholism, domestic violence and prostitution. They also carry the stigma of being the cause of deforestation in the rainforest, although it was the government who encouraged them to do so.</p>
