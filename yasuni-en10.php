        <div class="lead">Four main roads cross the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve to serve oil companies: via Auca, via Maxus, via Oxy (Edén Yuturi), and via Petrobras. According to estimates, each new kilometer of road openned in the tropical rainforest causes another 120 hectares of deforestation.</div>

        <h1>Via Auca</h1>

        <p>Throughout the 130 km of the highway known as via Auca, oil industry activities are evident in the daily lives of people. This paved road began construction in the 70s by Texaco, within the tropical rainforest of the territories of the Waorani people. Ever since, it has been the backbone of the oil industry in the province of Orellana. Through via Auca large trucks come and go with their cargo of new oil pipes to replace old ducts that are a leak hazard. Via Auca also favored the increase of hunting and lumber extraction.</p>

        <p>Lying to the south of the city of Francisco de Orellana, via Auca winds its way between two platforms that burn the gas that emanates from the wells. Recently, more modern equipment was installed in order to extract the more difficult oil from these fields. After 30 years now, they are close to depletion. Along the highway, one can see oil polluted lakes that form a blackened smooth surface.</p>

        <p>From north to south, via Auca crosses the provinces of Orellana and Pastaza. Its final leg crosses a region of Waorani communities to the west of the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve. Nowadays, a population of 11 thousand settlers lives in the vicinity of the highway. On the eastern side of the road, there are communities close to the border of the national park, areas which are also used by the indigenous people. Via Auca helps the fast growth of the population of migrants that gradually transform the forest into a cultivated frontier. Simultaneously, the oil industry forges ahead drilling the ground.</p>

        <p class="legend"><b>Forms of settlement:</b> This satellite image shows how roads allow the encroachment of newcomers and the devastation of the forest</p>
        </div>

        <p>Ulvio Torres lives in the community of Puma, just a few meters from a road that begins on via Auca. He arrived there with his family in 1979, lured by the offer of land made by the government at that time. In a similar manner to the peasants from Loja, Tungurahua, Bolívar and Manabí, who fled the drought in their provinces, Ulvio found a hostile land for agriculture and a cruel neighbor: oil. “When I arrived here back in 1979, a primary forest thrived along all routes and rivers were clean and alive with fish. People were healthier”, he recalls.</p>

        <p>Pipes that flow their oil load along the highway pass in front of his land. Ulvio says leaks are recurring. Today, there’s a greater degree of control, but ten years ago, he says, oil companies even accused peasants of causing leaks in order to obtain compensations. According to him, these accusations were false.</p>

        <p>Ulvio is one of the few settlers dedicated to agriculture, for most of them work for the oil companies. Those hired to clean up leaks earn about US$300 per month. Ulvio believes that they risk exposure to serious skin and stomach diseases, not to mention cancer. “Some people go to work for an oil company cleaning up [spilled] oil, and I told my buddies not to get into that sort of thing, arguing that if they [the oil companies] leak oil, they should clean it up themselves. But they go anyhow and end up sick”.</p>

        <p>To attract settlers to this region of the Amazon, the government of Ecuador promised to give 50 hectares of land in exchange that the new comers deforest half of it. This policy soon caused the region around via Auca to be ruined. “Anyone wandering along the complex of secondary roads in the via Auca territory notices that deforestation is very high”, says Eugenio Pappalardo, a doctor of human geography who has been studying Yasuní for eight years. “Via Auca has been the exploitation and productive vector of the oil industry and at the same time, of the agricultural colonization of this area”.</p>

        <p>According to the report “Biodiversity Hotspots for Conservation Priorities”, published by Nature magazine, the Auca transportation system is listed in 14th place among the major tropical deforestation fronts and is one of Yasuní’s worst problems.</p>

        <h1>Secondary Roads</h1>

        <p>On the smaller roads that stem from via Auca, the situation is about the same: human settlements, agriculture, deforestation, contamination, oil leaks and the constant coming and going of trucks and platforms connected to oil drilling activities. Of these roads, the only one that goes up to Yasuní National Park is the Pindo-Tobeta road. This almost 35 km long secondary road reaches up to oil block 14 and crosses park borders, very close to the headwaters of Tiputini River.</p>

        <p>Since 1994, Yasuní also has to share its space with via Maxus, a highway controlled by Repsol that forges into the national park and into Waorani territory as well. Its surroundings suffer from the empty forest syndrome: the jungle seems relatively fine, but its animals are no longer there. “Although there is no deforestation, wildlife has already declined into a state of collapse and that is something we can measure”, explains Esteban Suárez, whose study on the hunting and sale of wildlife meat showed the decline of species of fauna.</p>

        <p>Via Maxus increased commercial hunting as it makes forest entry easy as well as the transportation of animals to the market in Pompeya. The road was gradually extended up to block 16 as new oil wells were opened and began to produce in this area of the park.</p>

        <p>Another highway is via Oxy, built by Occidental in 2003, located in plot 15 and exploited by Petroamazonas (Ecuador’s state owned oil company), in the park’s buffer zone. The road is used exclusively by the company for activities connected to oil drilling, as well as to shuttle its employees. Via Oxy is fundamental for oil industry activity since plot 15 is Ecuador’s most productive field with a production of 13 million barrels a year.</p>

        <p>On the southern bank of river Napo lies Chiro Isla, a small river port connected to another road, whose construction was initiated by Petrobras, the giant Brazilian state owned oil company. Located to the east of via Maxus, it is the newest road in this territory. Also known as via Petrobras, it is opposed by environmentalist groups. In 2007, they cheered when the Ecuadorian government suspended the environmental license issued for its construction due to inconsistencies between the project and preservation goals. Petrobras left and Petroamazonas discretely resumed the construction job. In 2013, via Petrobras reached 14.5 km and came up to the north bank of Tiputini River (a national park border). All appearances show that it will serve to operate ITT fields.</p>

        <p>Exploitation of the ITT plot brings forth the fear of new roads being built inside Yasuní National Park. The government denies that and says that machine and personnel transportation will take place by river and by helicopters. Authorities say no new roads will be built, but rather “ecologic trails” will be opened that will enable control over oil company operations. In plot 31, a long dirt road opened in the middle of the forest is an example of this concept, as shown on <a href="http://es.mongabay.com/news/2013/es1112-yasuni-secret-oil-road-finer.html" target="_blank">air surveillance photographs</a> taken in August 2012 by <a href="http://ivankphoto.com/" target="_blank">Ivan Kashinsky</a> and <a href="http://www.karlagachet.com/" target="_blank">Karla Gachet</a> during a National Geographic expedition.</p>

        <p>There is a possibility of building yet another road, this time in plot 43-ITT, close to the Ishpingo oil field. It concerns environmentalists since it would lie close to the intangible zone of Yasuní National Park where isolated indigenous tribes dwell.</p>
